Course Project Code Book
======

This document is the Code Book for the Coursera Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project.

Because the course project required to compute means on existing columns of the Samsung data set all such column names have been preserved in the resulting set and their description is not repeated here.

Hence, this document only describes the additional column names which did not exist in the original set.

> I realize this will grant me a lower mark in the peer evaluation, but I believe that repeating all such information here is mainly a waste of time.

## Variables

**activity**
 The descriptive name of the activity

**subject**
 The numeric index of the subject

**other columns**
All other columns preserve their names as in the original Samsung set. The values represent the mean of each original variable, grouped by activity and subject
